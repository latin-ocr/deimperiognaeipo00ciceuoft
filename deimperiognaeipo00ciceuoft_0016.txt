Cappadocia: and to this end an embassy was sent to
Asia, at the head of which was the consular Μ’.-
Aquillius: their demands were to be supported by
L. Classius, the Roman governor of the province of
Asia. The military forces which Cassius had already

extensive levies in Galatia and Phrygia, and thus the
exiled kings were restored to their dominions by force
of arms. Not contented with having recovered his
throne, Nicomedes, pressed by the demands for money
made -by the Roman generals, then made an inroad
into the >territory of Mithridates, pillaging it as far as
the town of Amastris, without meeting any enemy.

occasioned this raid ; but he sent a Greek agent, named
Pelopidas, to the Roman envoys, to obtain satisfaction
from them. As might have been expected, their
answer was one of hesitation and refusal. The king
thereupon, regardjng the rejection of his claim for
satisfaction as an open breach, sent his son Ariarathes
with a large army into Cappadocia, to seize the throne.
In a short time Ariobarzanes was driven out, and
Ariarathes master of the land. Its occupation was
the signal for the outbreak of the war with Rome
