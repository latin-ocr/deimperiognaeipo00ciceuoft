INTROD U ΟΤΙ ON. xvii

9. These successes on the part of his new enemy
determined Mithridates to enter upon negotiations for
peace; to this end he sent Archelaus to Sulla. Sulla
was not disinclined to make peace. He was deficient
in ships and in supplies of money for the vigorous
carrying on of the war. It was also of importance for
’ him with his forces still unimpaired to drive the
opposing army, which had made its appearance from
Italy, out of the field as soon as possible ⁹⁷. However
the first negotiations led to no result. Thcreupon
Sulla marched through Thrace to the Hellespont‚
where his quaestor, L.⁴ Lucullus, joined him with a
fleet which had been brought up in the meantime, and
helped him in the transport of his troops'28. Sulla's
march and a formidable rising in Asia determined
Mithridates to ask for peace once more. This was
granted him by Sulla after a persona] conference at
Dardanus in the Troad in B.c. 84. The king was
restricted to his kingdom of Pontus, and required to
give up 80 ships of war and to pay 3000 ²⁹ talents as a
war contribution-more favourable conditions of peace
than he would have obtained had the state of political
circumstances been otherwise ³⁰.

10. After the conclusion of the treaty Sulla
marched against the legions of Fimbria3 on their re-
fusal to fight against their fellow-citizens, Fimbria
committed suicide, and Sulla united the two armies.
