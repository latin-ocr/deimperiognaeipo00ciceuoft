king still retained in his possession some portions of
Cappadocia. ΤΙιθ latter had withdrawn to his own
kingdom and reduced to submission the Colchians and
Bosporans who were wavering in‘their allegiance³⁰ ε to
this end he had created a new navy and'levied such large
forces, that it was soon said that such preparatione were
not directed against the Bosporans, but against a more
dangerous enemy, the Romans ³⁷. However, he did
not oppose any armed resistance to the inroads and
pillagings of Murena, but sent envoys to Rome to
complain of the proceedings of the lieutenant. But
as Murena paid no attention even to the orders of the
Senate to avoid all hostilities, but on the contrary
pushed forward as far· as the Halys in a new campaign of
plunder‚ Mithridates gave him a severe defeat⁸⁸, and
compelled him to retreat into Phrygia. Further
hostilities were avoided by the arrival of Aulus
Gabinius, who brought to Murena Sulla's commands
to abstain from all hostilities against Mithridates and
to effect a reconciliation between him and Ariobar-
zanes. Thus ended the second Mithridatio war.
Murena, though he had only carried off undefended
booty, and had gained no real victory over the enemy,
was allowed the honour of a triumph, which he cele-
brated in B.0. 80.

⁸⁶) ἀφισταμένους, App. 1. c. ³⁷) Appian says: ‘for
his campaign against the Bosporans he built ships and
collected a large army, so that the magnitude of his prepara·
tions quickly excited a suspicion that all this was collected,
not against the Bosporus, but against the Romans)
³⁸) App.65. Memnon, c. 36, gives a different account, represent-
ing the battle between Mithridates and Murena as indecisive,
and asserting that both sides retreated.
