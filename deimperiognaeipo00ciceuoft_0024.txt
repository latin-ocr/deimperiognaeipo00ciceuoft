12. When Mithridates had again secured reposo
on the side of the Romans, 116 subjugated the lands
on the Cimmerian Bosporus, over which he made one
of his sons, Machares, king. A campaign against the
Achaeans who lived behind Colchis, was less successful.
On his return from this Mithridates sent envoys to
Rome, to request from Sulla the written acknowledg-
ment of the peace. But about the same time Ariobar-
zanes complained at Rome that the king continued to
retain some districts of Cappadocia. At Sulla’s bidding
he at last evacuated the land, but sent a second
embassy to Rome, to secure the terms of peace in
writing. As this embassy found no support in the
Senate after the death of Sulla, which had happened
meanwhile, Mithridates prevailed upon his son-in-law
Tigranes to undertake a new invasion of Cappadocia.
Tigranes surrounded the land as though with anet and
swept off 300‚000 of the population to Armenia, to
provide inhabitants for the capital Tigranocerta
(Tigranes’ town), which he had himself built⁸⁹. The
Romans had no doubts as to the instigator of the deed,
but the serious war with Sertorius in Spain did not
allow them to act with energy in Asia. Two men of
the Marian party, L. Magius and L. Fannius, accord-
ing to one account deserters from the army of Valeriusw,
succeeded in persuading Mithridates to form an alliance
with Sertorius. Thus determined upon a new struggle
with Rome, he raised troops and secur'ed allies⁴¹ on
