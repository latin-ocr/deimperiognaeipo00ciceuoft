all sideS, and brought his forces up to a total of
140‚000 infantry and 16,000 cavalry⁴²‚ supported by a
powerful fleet.

13. With this vast army, in the year 74, he
invaded Bithynia, which king Nicomedes III„ who
had died shortly before without leaving any children,
had bequeathed to the Roman people. The governor
of the province, the consul M. Aurelius Cotta, an
incapable general, did not feel strong enough to resist
the attack, and retreated to Chalcedon. Thither the
Romans gathered from all sides. When Mithridates
proceeded to march against this town, Cotta tried the
fortune of war, but was beaten on land and at sea on
the same day ⁴⁸, and shut, up in the town. From this
dangerous position he was delivered by his colleague
L. Licinius Lucullus, who had received, with the pro—
vince of Cilicia⁴⁴, the supreme command by land in
the Pontio war, while the operations by sea were
assigned to his fellow-consul. The struggle was con-
centrated round the town of Cyzicus⁴⁵, the siege of

tribes which· composed his army are recounted by Appian, 69.
It appears from the letter which Sallust (Hist. Frag. 1v, 19)
represents Mithridates as writing to the Parthian king Arsaces,
that he had begged Tigranes to take part in the war, but in
vain. 4²) So Appian: according to Memnon, c. 37,
Mithridates, after sending off Diophantus with an army into
Cappadocia, himself led a force of 150‚000 infantry, 12‚000
cavalry, and 120 scythed chariots. ⁴3) Mithridates to
Arsaces (Sall. u. s.): M. Cottam Romanum ducem apud Chalce-
dona terra fudi, mari exui cbasse pulcherruma. Memnon, c.
39, states Cotta's loss by sea to have amounted to 8,ΟΟΟ dead
and 4,500 prisoners, by land to 5‚300 men. ⁴⁴) So
Plutarch, Lucull. 6: Memnon, c. 37, and Vell. Pat. 11. 33, name
Asia as his province: but Plutarch gives such precise details,
that his account probably deserves more confidence. ⁴⁸⁵) Cic.
