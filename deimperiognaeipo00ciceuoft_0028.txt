in his favour, brought the whole land under hispower
in the course of the year 72. But it took two >full
years more before all the towns were captumd⁴⁰. J· At

Oabira, we are told, as the baggage was being sent
·away from the enemy's camp, when flight was deter-
mined upon, the king himself was very nearly taken
prisoner. Lucullus had indeed, in his desire 130 eut off
the way of escape from the fieeing foe, given strict
orders to strike down every one, before proceeding to
plunder: but when his men saw the heaps of gold
and silver vessels and valuable robes that were flung
aside in the crush to get out of the camp, his orders
were forgotten, and plundering became general. Some
soldiers, who had got up to Mithridates himself,

aditu adventuque here are to be referred only to permultas, and
not also to Sinopen atque Amisum .· for both towns, and others
besides, such as Eupatoria, Heraclea, and Themiscyra were
only taken after an obstinate resistance. For details as to
the conquest of the country see Mommsen, Π. 5911.

whom Plutarch Lucull. 18 011 the whole agrees: the latter
gives the following sketch of the actual escape of the kingz
‘ the horse which carried the king was already within
reach of his pursuers, but as one of the mules which was
carrying the gold, either came in between them and the
king by accident, or was placed by the order of the king
between him and his pursuers, they seized and plundered the
gold, and then falling out among themselves missed their
