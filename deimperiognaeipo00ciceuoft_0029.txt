16. Lucullus, who had continued the pursuit of
the king up to* the Armenian frontier, now secured
the valuable trcasure which Mithridates had stored in
various strongholds⁵¹‚ liberated a number of politica]
prisoners from the state-dungeons‚ and sent his bro-
ther-in-law Appius Claudius into Armenia to Tigranes,
J to commence negotiations for peace on the basis of
³ the surrender of Mithridates. He himself went during
the winter into Western Asia, where he made equi-
table provisions, to alleviate in some degree the piti-
able condition of the province, which had nearly been
reduced to despair by the long sufferings from war,
the enormous exactions of Sulla, and the burdens of
the usurers. While he earned thereby the greatest
gratitude from the provincials‚ on the other hand his
humanity excited the hatred of the Roman equites,
who partly as sarmers of the state-dues, partly as
exchangers and usurerS‚ were draining the life-blood
of the province. Hence even at this time they were
endeavouring to bring Lucullus into odium at Rome,
and to disseminate the calumny that he was purposely
protracting the war from ambition and avarice: but

different, is to the following effect : ‘ he was desirous of fieeing
away from Cabira, where he was stafing, without the know-
ledge of the rest of his subjects3 and he would have been

fallen in with a mule which was bearing some gold and silver-
οἱ the treasures of Mithridates, and been delayed by plunder-
ing this: so he got off safe himself into Armenia! These
accounts, which agree in ascribing the escape of the king to

, the plundering of a mule, enable us to interpret aright the

statement of Cicero in 522. ⁶¹) Plut. Luc. 18. Sall.
