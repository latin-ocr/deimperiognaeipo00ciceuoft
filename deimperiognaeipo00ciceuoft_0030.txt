the plans of Mithridates to become embroiled with
Rome. A change was effected in this position by
the mission of Claudius, which had just the opposite
effect to that intended. Tigranes felt his royal pride
wounded both by the demand to give up his father-
in-law to his enemy, and by the haughty bearing of
Claudius ⁵⁹. He not only rejected the offers of the
Roman embassy‚ but now gave Mithridates, who had
already been for twenty months in his kingdom, but

foot soldiers, ordering him to bring back Lucullus
alive, and to trample down his little band ⁶⁶. The
