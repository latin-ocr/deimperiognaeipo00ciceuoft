consul, Q. Lutatius Catulus, in virtue of a special com-
mission frOm the Senate⁷⁶, and gave essential help in
driving him soon out of Italy and Cisalpine Gaul, and so
nipping in the bud a new civil war (77). The com—
mand which he then received served as a welcome

which Pompeius wrote from Spain to the senate, he says in
