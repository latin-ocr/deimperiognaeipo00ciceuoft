Cotta, which removed 1116 law-courts from the exclusive¹

sociessy ⁸⁶. The Romans had repeatedly sent out fleets
and armies to annihilatae the pirates3 and the great
successes which P. Servilius Vatia won in his three
years' campaign, 78—75, warranted 1116 hope that the
back of bhe evil had been broken: but shortly after his
return it broke out afresh with still grea'ner violence,
so that Rome was compelled ‘co have recourse to extra—
ordinary measureS. But this time a misbake was
made in 1116 choice of 1116 commander: M. Antonius,
the son of bhe orator and father of the triumvir, who
was sent out in 74 with 1116 most excensive powers,
earned nothing from his unlimited imperium but shame
and disgrace. The evil was increased by the renewal
of the war with Mithridates ; for the dispersion of his
fleets brought to 1116 pirates swarms of fresh freebooters.

yentium nationumque omnium. Cp. ξ 44 of this speech: com-

ac nationes premebamur.
