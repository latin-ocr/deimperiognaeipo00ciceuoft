xl INTRODUOTION.

more was conceded to Pompeius than Gabinius had
proposed: among other things, 24 lieutenants instead
of 15⁸⁸. The results even of his mere nomination was
a considerable fall in the price of corn and other
goods, so great were the expectations that were formed
of the experienced general ⁸⁹.

32. Pompeius fully justified the confidence that
was placed in him. In this, more than in any of his
wars, he displayed a rare capacity and activity. His
extremely skilful plan for the campaign was so formed
as first to clear the western sea, and starting thence to
scare the pirates out of all their cornere of refuge and
to drive them to the east, where they might receive
their couqo de yrdce. At the beginning of the spring
Pompeius traversed the whole of the western Medi-
terranean, and in the short space of 40 days drove the
pirates out of all their bays and harbours. He secured
the safety of the whole coast from Spain to the Tyr-
rhenian sea by a suitable distribution of strong naval
stations under the command of his lieutenants⁹⁰. Then
he returned to Rome, in order to set aside, by his per-
sonal intervention, the difficulties which the consul
O. Calpurnius Piso had raised against his equipments

non timetur.- contra in iis homines extraordinaria reformidant,
qui ea suo arbitrio aut deposituri aut retenturi videntur et
modum in voluntate habent. Dissuadebant optimates, sed con-
silia impetu victa sunt. For the illegality of this power, see
Mommsen, 1v. 103. ⁸8) App. Mithr. 94 mentions
25 lieutenants. ⁸⁹) Plut. Pomp. 26: ‘the immediate
fall in the price of wares made the delighted people say that
the mere name of Pompeius had put an end to the war.’
