position among the optimates. To say nothing of the
fact that it compelled the proconsuls Μ’. Acilius Gla-
brio and Q Marcius Rex to resign before the ter-
mination of their year of office⁹⁵, a commission, which
gave to a man, who had long overstepped the limits
of the equality that should rule among citizens, an
absolutely unprecedented extension of supreme power,
must have awakened their keenest displeasure. Hence
they pledged each other mutually to a unanimous and
most decided opposition: but when the time for
voting⁹⁶ drew near, they began to despair, in presence
of the feeling of the people, and all were silent except
Q. Lutatius Catulus and Q. Hortensius⁹⁷. But though
the speakers represented with conclusive arguments
the danger which threatened the common freedom from
the acceptance of the proposal, all arguments based
upon reason had to give way before the utterance
of the will of the people: the resolution, with the sup-
port of several senators⁹⁸, was passed by all the tribes.

M. Tullius Cicero. These, he says⁹⁹, supported the
rogation, not as deeming it beneficia] to the state,

rogation seems to have been brought directly before the people:
at least we have no intimation of any previous discussion, as
there had been in the case of the Gabinian law (Cic. 352).
