blamed in later years¹⁰¹. Undoubtedly several reasons
combined to induce him to do So. In the first place
he believed, as he himself expressly says, that, in view
of the manifest favour which the people had shown
him hitherto in electing him to one office after an-
other, he was obliged to justis-y the confidence reposed
in him, by throwing into the scale the great weight of
his expressed opinion, in his high position as prae-
tor. He wished in this way to discharge to the people
the tribute of his gratitude by meeting their wishes in
a question which excited so much interest; so that we
may well believe his assurances that he had not been

influenced by any special requests on the part of Pom-
102

peius or his friends in Rome to contribute his share ’

also to his glorification. But it is hard to determine
whether he was entirely free from any notion of per-
sonal advantage with respect to his own future canvass
for the consulship ¹⁴⁰³, or whether he felt so sure already
of the favour of the people that he ventured to expect
from them alone his advancement to the highest ho-
nours. Appearances speak for the former, while his
emphatic recommendation of the popular favourite bez
trays also the secondary design of secui-ing his own
influence with the people.
