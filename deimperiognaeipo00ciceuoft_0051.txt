viewed the question, we can explain the manner in
which he treated the case as an orator. The aim
of the speech is not so much to convince—for 1116
people were already prejudiced in favour of the pro-
posal—as to sustain this conviction¹⁰⁶. Β 116 had dis—

feelings of the people. This is shown also by the calm tone,
and the entire absence oi any strong expressions intended to
produce conviction. Almost all inferences are made with the
phrase “will an one still doubt?'’ Cp, cc. ’7, 10, 14, 15, 16,
23, 24.’ ⁰⁷) His own propositio is given by Cic. § 3:
dicendum est enim de Cn. Pompei simulari eoeimiaque virtute.
