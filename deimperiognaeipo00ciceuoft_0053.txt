tor’s special aim, the discussion of these two divisions
was certainly not out of place. It was intended to
carry the conviction that the war in question was
one, on the success of which the welfare of the state
depended, and that therefore the choice of a com·

argument of the third part, 111 which the general state-
ment¹⁰⁹ of the qualities required by a great general is
followed by the proof that Pompeius unites in himself
all these qualities in the highest degree ¹¹⁰. This part
of his speech Cicero has executed with great art, and
also with a certain moderat-,ion in his panegyric, which
is shown by the calmness of its tone. His ability comes
out conspicuously in the passages in which he speaks
of the success of Pompeius in the war with the pirates,
and his noble moderation in victory, and also where he
points out that the position of the Asiatic provinces
requires the appointment of one who knows how to be
not merely a soldier, but also a man, if these severely
tried countries are not to be utterly ruined. We
might have expected from the skill of the orator that
116 would not fail to employ in favour of Pompeius the
fortunate circumstance that he was at the very time

military discipline had disappeared‚ and the honour of the
Roman arms was imperilled. A victim of mutiny and jealousy,
to which a stronger man indeed would not have succumbed,

pro Roso.§62.110) Precisely the same kind of argu-
ment is put by Dio, xxxv1. 10, into the mouth of Gabinius,
when 116 is making a speech in support of his rogation on the
wars with the pirates.
