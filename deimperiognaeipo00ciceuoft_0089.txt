NOTES.

0. 1. §L conspectus, ‘sight‚’ in the passive sense, i. e.
here ‘assembly before my eyes:’ hence frequens vester not fre-
quentiae vestrae. Urequem, ‘crowded.']

locus, the rostra.- ep. §55 ad fin. ξ 70: ad agendum: i.e.
cum populo: a privilege of the higher magistrates: ad dicen-
dum, on the other hand, refers to private citizens, whom a ma-
gistrate allowed to speak from the orators' platform. And so
the adjectives correspond-amplissimus, ‘the most dignified, or

to be allowed to address a meeting from it.

[tamen belongs to the second clause only: the force is best
brought out by translating by an equivalent expression in the
passive voice 3 ‘yet 1 have been exeluded from this pathway to
fame, not indeed by my wishes hitherto, but by etc.']

optimo cuique, because it was open to the magistrates in
the first place.

vitae rationes, ‘plans of lifez’ cp. in Cat. 11. 13, ratio belli,
‘ plan of war‚’ pro Arch. 1, ratio studiorum.

ab ineunte aetate, i.e. from my entrance upon the life of a
citizen, after putting on the toya virilis.- this is always the
force of this phrase. Cic. came forward as an orator first
when he was 26 years of age, but at first only in causae pri-
vatae. [The speech de imperio Cn. Pompei was the first of his
public orations, so far as we know. Cicero probably avoided
political speeches, that he might not be compelled to pledge
himself too soon to any party in politica]

[per aetatem, ‘owing to my youth? per is often used of the
hindering or permitting reason 3 e. g. per me licet eto.]
