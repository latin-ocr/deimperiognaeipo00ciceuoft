32 NOTES.

huius auctoritatem loci, ‘this place of influence,’ which in
itself carries a certain weight.

perfectum ingemo, ‘finished with all one’s powers,’ which
needs maturity of years; elaboratum industria, ‘diligently'
worked out,' which is gained by varied practice. [Elaboran-
always carries with it the notion of successful endeavour, which
laborare does not. see note on de Orat. 1. 5, 18. ]

[tcmponbus, ‘requirements;’ chosen as affording a kind
of play upon words in its juxtaposition with tempus, gwhich is
used m its ordinary sense of time. The rhetoricia‘ns gave the
name of πλοκή to this kind of traductio, when‘ continenter
unum verbum ‘non eadem sententia ponitur. ⁹ (Cic. Orat. ξ 135). ]

ξ 2. ita refers to the second clause labor fractum est conse-
cutus, and the first clause, which is logically subordinate, is
made coordinate, in order to secure a regular form for the rhe-
torical antithesis. Translate. ‘so, while this place has never
been without men...my exertions.’

[vestram causam=causam rei p. in ξ 4.]

caste integreque, ‘purely and irreproachably‚’ i.e. he took
no presents contrary to the provisions of the lex Gincia [nc.
204, which forbade advocates to receive any fees]‚ and never
allowed himself to be bribed by the other side, to conduct the

case of his client badly on purpose (praevaricatio).

[versatus, a favourite word with Cicero: ‘was engaged
with& here we may render ‘ was confined to.’]

propter dilationem comitiorum. Elections were postponcd
if the omens were reported to be adverse, or a storm came on.
[Cassius Dio xxxv-1. 39 tells us that the quarrels between the
candidates for office in B.c. 67 led to fighting in the streets,
which may have been a reason for postponing the election.]

praetor primus, not ‘ as the first praetor‚’ for there was no
such distinction of rank, but ‘ first,’ ‘in the first place,' among
the eight who were to be chosen. Cic. received the votes of all
the centuries, and was thus the first to receive the neces
majority3 but the ‘ distribution of the voting-tickets’ (diribitio)
for the others was still going on, when the electione were inter-
rupted.

[auctoritatis. The fact that the people had chosen Cicero
for high office (honores) would naturally increase the weight of
his personal influence (auctoritas).]

vigilanti, ‘ active, energetic‚’ opposed to iners, iynavus.

[forens1‚ ‘in the law-courts,’ the courts of law being held
sometimes in the open air in the forum, sometimes in the basi-
licae round it.]

utar, ‘I will make use of this,' the demonstrative being
