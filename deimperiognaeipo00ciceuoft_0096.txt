coniectum perspicite, quantum illud bellum factum sit would
be ‘how great that war has become;‘ while sactum putetis is
‘how great it may (in your view) have become.’

c. v. mercatoribus, as in Verr. ν. 149, quot bella maiores
nostros et quanta suscepisse arbitramini, quod cives Romani
iniuria adfecti, quod navicularii retenti, quod mercatores spo-
liati dicerentur?

[iniuriosius ‘ somewhat insultingly.‘] [vost we should
insert ‘ and.’]

tot milibus, Introd. note 19 f. [Wherever a long t is fol-
lowed by a short i in the next syllable, one l, not two, should be

written: hence mille, milia ; villa, vilicus, etc. are the best-
established spellings. Of. Lachmann on Lucr. 1. 313.]

- appellati superbius, ⁴ addressed somewhat haughtily’ at an
assembly of the Achaean League, of which Polybius gives the
fullest account3 he says (Exc. Leg. xxxvnr. 4, 4): ‘and when
they heard this [the words of the Roman ambassadors] most of
them put no manner of restraint upon themselves, but mocking
tho envoys they drove them out [from the assembly] with noise
and shouting.’ Other accounts speak even of personal ill-
treatment3 Florus 1. 32, 2, Critolaus‘causa belli, qui libertate
a Romanis data adversus ipsos usus est leqatosque Romanos,
dubium an et manu, certe oratione violavit: and esp. Livii per.
m„ belli Achaici semina referuntur haec, quod leqati Romani ab
Achaicis pulsati sint Corinthi, and ιη, qui (L. Mummius) omni
Achaia in deditionem accepta Corinthon ex s. c. dimit, quia ibi
leyati Romani violati erant. Cp. Mommsen, 111. 46 f. Cicero
for rhetorical reasons has followed the mildest tradition: he
says himself, de Off. 1. ς 35: maiores nostri Karthaqinem et
Numantiam funditus sustulerunt; nollem Corinthum, sed credo
aliquid secutos, opportunitatem loci maxime, ne posset aliquando
ad bellum faciendum locus ipse adhortari.

Graeciae lumen: as it is called in a verse quoted-by Dio-
dorus-2 Κόρινθος ἄστρον οὐκ ἄσημον Ἑλλάδος. The predicate is
constructed with lumen, because the figure of the word in appo-
sition is kept up in the verb, as in Verr. 1. 153, communi prae-
sidio talis improbitas tamquam aliquod incendium restinquendum
est. [Brut. ἓ 262, omni ornatu orationis tanquam veste detracta.
Notice the gender of Corinthusj.

[esse is more commonly omitted with volo so used.]
