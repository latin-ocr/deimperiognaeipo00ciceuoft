antithesis: but cp. Cic. Orat. 137, sic dicet ille (orator) quem
expetimus, ut verset saepe multis modis eadem et una in re haereat
in eademque commoretur sententia. The rhetoricians name this
form of speech expolitio or commoratio: cp. ad Herenn. Π.

ius leuatiom’s cp. Cic. de Har. Resp. 34, sic enim sentio, ivs
leqatomtm cum hominum praesidio munitum sit, tum etiam divino

cuncta Asia, the preposition in is omitted after the analogy
of tota Asia. Sall. J ug. 79 has -the still more unusual construc-
tion, qua tempestate K arthayiniemes pleraque Africa imperita-

the more grieved to lose his help.’

adventu ipso, ⁴ by his mere arriva1,’ as in ξς 15, 45.

impetus repressos: the fact that Mithridates, after his

ascribed to the neighbourhood of Pompeius, on the ground that
he saw his flank threatened by the army of Pompeius. [Cp.
Mommsen, ιν. 116.]

ceteros: we should say ‘in other cases.’
[ipsorum used to mark the antithesis with hostium]
