NOTES. ἐξ 16—18. 41

to scriptlura above, as in ayo-is to decumis and in portubus
to portu.

portubus, as in ξ 55. According to the MSS. Cicero uses
both this form and also portibus: the latter in Verr. Π. 118,
ξτὲὄ Flacco 27, and according to eod. Tegern. also below in

custodiis, ‘ coast-guard posts‚' which served to prevent goods
liable to duty from being brought in and unloaded anywhere
but at the emporia, where the custom-houses were. Thus
in Attica no goods could be unloaded except in the emporium
of the Piraeus.

c. vn. ξ 17. [ne fflud quidem. ‘This too is not‚’ etc„
a common form of transition to a new subject]

eum essem dicturus, ⁴ when I began to speak.'
pertinet, sc. belli glenus, ‘that it affects.’

et publicani. Cic. begins with an enumeration [et= ‘in
the first place ’]‚ as though a second clause with et were to
follow: instead of this, after developing the first at some length,
he goes on in a different way with deinde in ξ 18.

ornatissimi, ‘ well-furnished,’ i. e. wealthy, as men of

suas rationes contulerunt] i. e. they have directed their

[ipsorum per se, ‘ of themselves: even without regard to
the interests of others and of the state]

[vectigalia nervos esse rel p. Cp. our saying, ‘money
is the sinews of war.']

ceterorum ordinum, the senatorial order, and the third
class (the citizens in general), together with those of the ordo
equester who did not belong to the special ordo publicanorum.
The following words, ex ceteris ordinibus, are to be taken in
a narrower sense, ‘of other companies or corporations,’ like
those formed by the mercham, ship-owners (navicularii), and
exchangers, just as we speak of the merchant-class, etc. [Cp.
in Verr. 11. 517, si cuiquam ordini sive aratorum sive pe-
cum-iorum sive mercatorum probatus sia]

pecunias, ‘ sums of money,' hence myrtae, not multas:
cp. Krebs Antibarbarus s. v'. multus. [Senators were not allowed
