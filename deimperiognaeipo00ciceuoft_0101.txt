NOTES. gg 19-21, 43

quare videte, a recapitulation of the first section of the
speech, mentioning the four points of view in which the ne-
cessity of the war had been established.

incumbere. Cp. Caes. B. G. v11. 76, ut omnes et animis
ct opibus in id bellum incumberent. Dem. Olynth. 1. ἓ 6, φημὶ
δεῖν τῷ πολέμῳ προσέχειν.

fortunae coniunctae cum re p., i.e. the property of citizens,
with which the interest of the state is so closely concerned.

c. V111. ἓ 20. Quoniam, we should say ‘after speaking!
Cic. is fond of quoniam in such transitions: cp. pro Rosc. ἓ 119.

de magnitudine. Cp. ἓ 4, bellum 9rave et periculosum. §27,
bellum maynitudine periculosum.

bem genus, see note on ξ 6. [non esse, ‘but is not.']
in quo, ‘ on this point.’

[ea vobis. The MSS. read a vobis, which was corrected by
Buttmann. Cic. not unfrequently uses a with the ablative
after a gerundive to denote the agent, but only when the per-
sonal agency is to be brought into prominence‚ or when the
gerundive governs a dative: op. ἓ 34, a me praetereunda mm
sunt]

Lucuno. The digression in praise of Lucullus is introduced
here, that it may not be assumed from Cic.’s demonstration
of the greatness and danger of the war, that he is desirous of
disparaging his military services. The eulogy had to be brought
in before the second part of the tractatio, because it would
have found less credence if placed further on: here it at once
excites the desire of the hearers to learn how it can have
happened that in spite of the 'successes achieved there is still
so much to be done before the war is completely settled.

dico, ‘ I assert‚' stronger than our ‘ say.’

eius adventu, ‘at the time of his arrival? cp. Caes. B. G.
v. 54, cuius frater adventu Caesaris in Galliam reynum ob-
tinuerat.

maximas Mithridatis copias. Introd. note 42.

instructas fuisse would have been in the indicative in-
structae erant: on the other hand obsessam esse=obsidebatur.

Asiae elmssimam. Florus, 1. 40. 15, Cyzicus, nobilis civitas,
arce, moenibus, portu turribusque marmoreis Asiaticae playae
litora inlustrat. Introd. note 45 f.

ς 21. classem. Introd. ξ 14, and note 47.
studio, ‘with party-spirit‚’ ‘the rage of party-feeling)
w. 7
