NOTES. ἐξ 23, 24. 45

g 23. excepit. Introd. ς 17.
plures gentes, Plut. Luc. c. 26.

lacessere bello, by war, i.e. by eommencing hostilities to
provoke and challenge to fight: on the other hand temptare
aliquem (which is not to be connected with bello) is ‘to come
too near anyone,' to try how far they will stand unfair treat-
ment, for which a warlike demonstration is not necessary.
[For the reluctance of the senate to interfere in Asia Minor,
cp. Mommsen, 1v. 49.]

alia opinio: to the excitement of the political suspicion
(metus iniectus) that the subjugation of the various tribes is
intended, Cicero opposes the religione suspicion, gravis et
vehemens opinio, ‘a deep and violent suspicion’ (exciting
fanaticism).

ammos pervaserat: but in ξ 44, oram quo (εἰη quam) per-
vaserit. Cp. also pro Sulla, 53, quas in oras morbus illius furoris
pervaserat: in Verr. v. 6, nulla pars eius belli in Italiam
pervasit, and notice the different force of these various con-
structions.

fani, ‘ of the Persian Nanaea or Anaitis in Elymais or the
modern Luristan, the most celebrated and richest shrine in
the whole region of the Euphrates.’ Mommsen, 1v. 67 [cp.
his note there}

urbem ex Tigranis regno. Gic. uses this expression, not
merely to avoid the two genitives Tiqranis reyni, but to bring
into prominence the isolated character of the capture of this
one town [and thus to minimize the successes of Lucullus}

nimia longinquitate. The orator says nothing of the main

reason, the mutiny of the army (Introd. ἕ 18), to spare the
honour of the Roman name.

ξ 24. et eorum] If the reading is sound here, eorum
depends upon the following auxiliis, if no ablative, as e. g.

copiis, has fallen out. Others reject the clause et eorum...
colleqerant as an interpolation.

fortunae. The plural, because the fortunes of several kings
are spoken 0f3 [we have the word used in the plural of the
good fortune of one in Ter. Andr. 1. 1. 69, tum uno ore omnes
omnia bona dicere et laudare fortunas meas, and in Tusc. Disp.
v. ἕ 115, eiusque laudare fortunas, but this is rare].

multorum opes adliciant ad misericordiam. The con-
nexion of the material opes with misericordia, which assumes

a feeling, is awkward: hence translate ‘moves many men of
power to pity.’
