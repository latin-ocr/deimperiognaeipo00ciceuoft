Orat. 46, pro Rosc. 62 ff. Gabinius in his rogation, according
to the account of Cassius Dio xxxv1. 10, had already recom-
mended Pompeius, on the ground of these same advantages:
hence we must assume that Dio, in the speech which he puts into
the mouth of Gabinius, makes use of this speech of Cicero’s.
This interesting passage is also instructive for the true idea of
virtus, for which Dio says: δεῖ φῦναι πρὸς αὐτὸ (τὸ στρατηγεῖν)

Luc. had served with distinction in the Social War and the
