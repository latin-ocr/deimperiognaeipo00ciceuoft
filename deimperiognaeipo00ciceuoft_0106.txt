licola and Gn, Lentulus Clodianus, and to the usual question as
to the campaigns whichlhe had served (⁴1 ask you, Pompeius
Magnus, whether you have served all the campaigns required
by the law ?’ Plut. Pomp. 22), returned the vain answer: ‘I have
served them all, and all under my own supreme command?

fortuna rei p. The unhappy condition of the state, which
was engaged in so many serious wars.

civile, against Cinna (Introd. ἓ 22), Carbo (ᾖ 24), and Lepi-
dus (ἕ 26) : Africanum, Introd. ξ 24; Τταηεελρωωη, Introd. note
78: Hispaniense, ξ 27.

mixtum, etc. The bracketed words are bad Latin [whence
some read civibus for civitatibus] and spoil the neatness of the
structure: hence they are evidently spurious,

diversa genera et bellorum et hostium. The division is
not logically exact: it ought properly to have been, yenera
bellorum, diversa et ratione gerendi (war by land and sea, open
and guerifla warfare) et ‚qenere hostium. [Or we may take
‘diversa as ‘ far distant from each other‚’ and as referring logi-
cally only to bella]

esse, ‘that there is.’ The position of the words shows

fflae sunt, etc„ i.e. illae virtutes imperatoriae, quae vulgo
existimantur (i. e. are regarded as such) uo'rt sunt solae virtutes
imperatoriae. This ought to be followed by sed aliae sunt
praeterea, but this idea is not expressed until ξ 36, and then it
is put in a different way. Virtutes here denotes ‘ good quali-
ties, advantagesz’ the sum of them is the virtus imperatoria,
for which see ἓ 28. The virtutes vulgares make up the bellandi
virtus (ἓ 36), which of itself cannot constitute a perfect im-

any rate with the people at large.
