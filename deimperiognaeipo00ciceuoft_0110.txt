plans for the campaign.

by the legati of Pompeius: see Flor. 1. 41. 9, Gellius Tusco mari
impositus, Plotius Siculo, etc.

ista vis comparabatur.

Achaiam omnemque Graeciam. Cicero uses this expres-
sion, because the name Achaia, which often embraces only
the Peloponnesus, had not yet come to be generally current
for all Greece; ior the provincia Achaia was not formally
constituted immediately after Greece fell into the hands of
Rome in 146: cp. Mommsen Hist. 111. p. 50. Hence we often
find in writings of this date Graecia and Achaia mentioned
side by side, as in Pis. 37 leye ea omnis erat tibi Achaia,
Thessalia, Athenae, cuncta Graecia addicta.

mitto. These passages [like Vergil’s pateris libamus et auro]
show that in the so—called hendiadys the first member always
gives a complete sense by itself, and a second, also quite ableto
stand alone, is added for the sake of closer specification.
