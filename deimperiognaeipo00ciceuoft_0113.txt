mcx-edibilem cursum. ⁶ Inconceivable rapidity.’ Gp. pro
Rosc. ξ 97, quid hic incredibilis cursus, quid haec tanta celeritas

inventum. ⁸ Attained,’ from the primary notion of invenire
‘to come upon,’ hence ‘acquiret’ cp. pro Suu. 583, memoria
per me inventae salutis. Tusa. D. 1v. 49, Torquatum illum, qui
hoc coqnomen invenit, i.e. acquired.

[amoemtas. In classical prose always of natural beauty of
position, scenery, etc.]

nobmtas urbis, perhaps with reference to the fact mentioned

by Plut. Pomp. 27, ‘ though pressed for time and hurrying past
other cities, he still did not pass by Athens, but landed and
went up to the city; but after sacrificing to the gods and ad-

dressing the people he went away at once.’

labor. See note on g 29.

1 [em] Redundant, but resuming signa, etc„ after the relative
c ause.

ξ 41. de caelo delapsum. As a messenger from heaven, an
envoy of the gods. The descent of the gods to earth was often
denoted by delabi.- as Ovid Met. 1. 212 says of J uppiter, summo
delabor Olympo, et deus humana lustro sub imagine terras. [So
Cic. writes to his brother Quintus (ad Q. fratr. 1. 1, 7), that if
he follows his advice the Greeks will think ‘quendam ea: anna-
lium memoria aut etiam' de caelo divinum hominem esse 'In

provinciam delapsum.’]

fmsse. ‘ That there really were‚’ as is shown by the position
of fuisse .· cp. ξ 47, fuit enim profecto, etc. We might have ex-
pected quondam to go with suisa-«23 but Cic. prefers to connect it
more closely with hac continentia in the sense of ‘ who once
showed this sels-control? hac, which we have now lived to see.

quod iam videbatur. ‘ Which was by degrees beginning to
appear.’

splendor. We might express this by means of a stronger
metaphor: the sun of your empire has now begun to shed its
beneficent rays over the natione.

§42 liberae, ‘unhindered.’

principibus excellit, so above ἕ 39, excellere ceteris, Tusc. D.
11. 43, ceteris excellebat; it is more common to find the con-

struction inter (super) ceteros excellere.

[saumata ‘ easiness of access : ’ cp. Plut. Pomp. 1, ‘ his affa-
bility in conversation and address‚ insomuch that no man ever
asked a favour with less offence, or conferred one with a better

grace. ’]
