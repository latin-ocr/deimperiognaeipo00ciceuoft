Noms ἐς 44—46. - 57

by neque in Verr. 111. 5 115, ut hoc tempore ea...praetermittam,
neque eos appellemJ, literally, ‘so as not to‚' the ut denoting
result, not purpose3 hence we have in Verr. 1v. 45, ut non
conferam vitam neque existimationem tuam cum illius. ne dicam
has quite a different force, and implies that a man would be
afraid that he was saying too much if he said so and so, hence,
it almost :prope dixerim. Cp. Halm’s note on pro Milone

[qui quo dle, ‘ for on the day on which he,’ etc.]
vilitas annonae. Introd. note 89.

unius hominis spe ac nomine, ‘from our hope in this one
man and from his name.’ hominis is an objective genitive to
spe, a possessive genitive to nomine: as in 529 (hiemis.. ,avaritiae
persuyium) there were two genitives of different characters de-
pendent upon one substantive, so here there is one genitive
dependent upon two substantives, with a different relation in
each case.

5 45. ex eo proelio. Introd. 5 19 ad fin. admonui 5 25.

ad ,ipsum discrimen eius temporis. ⁴ At the decisive mo-
ment of that critical time.’ Cic. ad Fam. 11. 7, 2, iudicio tuo,
mm casu, in ipsum discrimen reram contulisti tribunatum tuum.
[ad tempus non venit. Sall. Iug. 70, 5].

ad eas regiones, ⁴ into the neighbourhood of those regions.’
continuit. See note on 5 13.

declarat auctoritatem. Cic. here, in accordance with his
purpose, ascribes to the influence o'f the character of Pompeius
what had happened for other reasons.

diversis, 5 8. [huic se uni: for Cicero's tendency to bring
pronouns together, see note on Cic. Cat. 1. 3, 6.]

noster imperator, 5 26.
111 ultimas terras. See note on 5 35.

ad eundem cn. Pompeium, ‘not to Metellus Pius, the other
general in the war with Sertorius, for his reputation was much
less. In order to oblige the people and their favourite, Cic. is
never weary of attacking the leading men in Rome, which after-
wards bore bitter fruits for him. The fact itself is invented or
at any rate misrepresented. According to all other authorities
Mithridates negotiated with Sertorius, not with Pompeius: the
utmost we can concede is that Pompeius caught a spy of the
king in his camp, and in his vanity believed his story that he
had a commission for him.’ Drumann.
