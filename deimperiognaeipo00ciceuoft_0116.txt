[eum and Pompeius legatum semper iudicavit are bracketed
by Eberhard as a gloss, which impairs the sense and structure
of the sentence]

Metellus PiusJ.

[ad eum potissimum, ‘ to him rather than to anyone else ’.]
constituere, see note on ἕ 38, and on ξ 11.

et ceteris, et might have been omitted, according to the
rule that et and ac in sentences of three or more clauses, when
the preceding clauses are without the copula, are not used in
the last: but et may be inserted when the last clause with
ceteri (reliqui) is a general one: for we have thus two series,
the single clauses which are not connected by any conjunction,
and the last general clau'se to conclude with: [cp. de Orat.
11. 46]. ⁹

usual order, where we might have expected ut non.]

[aut invisa, ‘on the one hand displeasing,’ i. e. si dicam.-
aut ing-rata, ‘or on the other hand ungratefuL' if I do not
call to mind the favours already shown which warrant us in
forming hopes for the future]
