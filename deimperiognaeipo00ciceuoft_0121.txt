ne legaretur. The senate had the power of nominating
the temti, but it was accustomed in so doing to take into
consideration the wishes of the commanders and governors.
ΟΡ. Marquardt Rom. Staatsv. 1. 386. Pompeius had received
the privilege of nominating his own leyati for the war against
the pirates3 but he was prevented from appointing Gabinius,
not merely by a regard to the circumstances generally, but
also by the lex Licinia et Aebutia, which ordained that if any
one brought forward a proposal with regard to any potestas or
curatio, neither he himself, nor his colleagues‚ nor his relations
could be entrusted with it: and this naturally included also
the right of holding any subordinate office in connexion with
it. Now the nomination, which Pompeius himself had for
these reasons failed to make, lapsed after a certain time to
the senate, and they naturally did not turn a favourable ear
to the improper suggestion. For when it was made, Pompeius
had not yet been commissioned to take charge of the war
against Mithridates ε hence he asked for Gabinius as a lieutenant
in the imperium which he owed to the law introduced by him.

xxxV1. 7 tells us that Gabinius was actually exposed to personal
danger in bringing forward his proposal ε ‘ the senate preferred
to endure anything at the hands of the pirates, rather than
to put such power into his hands, and they very nearly killed
Gabinius in the senate-house itself.' ΟΡ. Mommsen 1v. 107.

the thought, and which we should bring in as a subordinate
clause by ‘while‚' is coordinated as a main clause; just as
in Greek such antitheses are regularly introduced by μέν and
