phrase shows that they were living at the time]

it was as a rule illegal or at any rate unusual to accept a
post as leyatus immediately after the tribunate: but it may
be doubted whether the tribunes mentioned were leyati to
generals who owed their appointment to them; if not, the

praetor. But this was so far limited that any magistrate
who held the same office or a higher one had the right of
vetoing the introduction of the question: the consuls could
also get rid of a question of which they did not approve by
issuing a decree (inimicum edictam) that no one should bring
