ab uno imperatore, 1. 0. Scipio Aemilianus. In the second Α
half of the second century Β. o. there was a law in existence
which forbade‘ ne quis consul bis fier-ets and this was probably
in force even in the time of Marius. cp. Livii per. 56 and
. Mommsen' s Ro'm. Staatsrecht² 1. 502; [but in spite of this,
Scipio was elected consul in 147 (when only standing for the
aedileship), and again in 134: cp. Mommsen 111.16‚ 35].

Teutanes occurs first in Velleius Palm-culus]

summa Q. catuli voluntate. It is by no means certain
that Catulus himself approved of these unprecedented powers;
but they were sanctioned by the optimates, among whom he
was always a leading man.

c. xx1. ξ 61. Quid tam novum, sc. fuit. conficere, ‘ raise.'

ductu suo, [1. q. suis imperiis ἓ 28]: cp. Pomp. epist. ad
Sen. (Sall. Hist. fr. 111. 1), si adversus vos patriamque et deos

adulescentia ductu meo scelestissimi hostes fusi et vobis salus
quaesita est, nihil amplius in absentem me statuissetis quam
adhuc aqitis. a senatorio gradu. From the time of Sulla the
quaestorship entitled a man to admission into the senate,
and at this time the office could not be held before the com-
pletion of the thirtieth year of one’s age: [but Pompeius in
ac. 82 when he was sent to Sicily was only 24]. For senatorius
yradus, ‘the rank of senator,’ cp. Nagelsb. Stil. ἓ 20, 2.

gravitate. The firm action of Pompeius against Cn. Carbo
was called by his enemies crudelitas: see esp. Val. Max. VI.

thinking here rather of the grave and dignified bearing, sor
which Pompeius was remarkable, even when still very young.

vidit, ‘has lived to see ι’ omnium studio, ‘with universal
enthusiasm‚’ as Cic. Cat. Mai. ξ 61 omnium fama, ‘general
repute.’ [visere, ‘ to fiock to see it.’] concelebrandam, by loud
acclamations, [holiday attire, and garlands].
