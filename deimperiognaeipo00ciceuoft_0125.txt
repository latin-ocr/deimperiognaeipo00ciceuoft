Nomas ,8 62. 67

ἕ 62. duo consules. Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus, and D.
Junius Brutus, 13.c. 77, [who had, however, declined to take
the command against Sertorius ε cp. Mommsen tv, 26].

ut, [wanting in the MSS. but supplied by Fleckeisen,
Eberhard inserts it after quam]: for the position of ut cp.
pro macc. ς 65, quid in sermone Graeco tam tritum atque
celebratum est quam, si quis despicatui ducitur, ut Mysorum
ultimus esse dicatur?

eques Romanus, Introd. note 77 ι pro consule=cum imperio
proconsulari ‘as proconsul! [The form proconsul is later than
pro consule, and rarely used in good authors: Sallust has
proconsulem]

L. Marcius Phfflppus, consul in Β. 0. 91, censor 86, a
zealous partisan of Sulla, and hence a great supporter of
Pompeius, known as an orator for his readiness in debate
and his biting wit: cp. Brut. 173, in altercando cum aliquo
aculeo facetus, de Orat. 1. 24, 111. 4.

pro consunbus. This bitter scoff at the consuls of the
time (who are called however clarissimi fortissimique) Gic.
cleverly presses into his service to set off his praise of Pom-
peius. As is shown by what follows, the expression of this

individual senator is at once made use of, as if it were an
admitted fact.

constituebatur, ‘was settled on him,’ ‘was built on himss
stronger than the more usual expression ponebatur.

[smmi-lare, ‘ unprecedented.’]

ex senatus consulto, is added on purpose, because, as
legislation was a matter for the popular assembly‚ strictly a
dispensation from the positive obligations of the laws could
only proceed from the people. Asconius in Cornel. p. 57,
promulgavitque (Cornelius in 13.c. 65) leyem, qua auctoritatem
senatus minuebat, ne qui nisi per populum leyibus solveretur.
Quod antiquo quoque iure erat cantum : itaque in omnibus sena-
tus consultis quibus aliquem leyibus solvi placebat, adici erat so-
litum, ut de ea re ad populum serretur‚· sed paulatim ferri erat
desitum, resque iam in eam consuetudinem venerat, ut postremo
ne adiceretur quidem in senatus consultis de roqatione ad populum
ferenda.

leg-ibus solutus, Introd. note 83, [cp. Mommsen 1v. 92 ff.].

unum anum. According to Mommsen (Rom. Staatsr.2 1.
549 f.), these words are to be understood literally: for as the
earliest age at which the consulship was attainable was 43,
for the quaestorship (in consequence of the intervals between
the various magistracies) 37 was the legal age, though in
practice men were generally allowed to hold the quaestorship
