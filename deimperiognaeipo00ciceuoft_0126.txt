after completing their thirtieth year Others explain the
words ullum alium as a rhetorical hyperbole, supposing the
curule offices only to be intended. When Pompeius en

on his consulship in B. c. 70 he was 352 years of age. [Cicero—
entered on his quaestorship two days before he was 31 years
of age. According to the usual view two clear years were
required to elapse between the various curule magistracies‚
so that if 43 was the regular year for the consulship, 37 would
be that for the aedileship. Op. Ramesy, Rom. Antiq. pp.

in omnibus hominibus, ‘in the case of all men.’ homi-
nibus hominum...homine‚ an instance of the figure called
traductio ; ‘ cum continenter unum verbum non eadem sen-

extraordinary powers ought not to be again conferred upon
him; hence the opposition to the G abinian law, which Cicero
does not quote as a novum, in order to be able to bring in the
elever hit at the optimates in c. xxn.

ξ 63. haec tot, strictly speaking only the last three, ex
senatus auctoritate: he passes over the command against
Lepidus, Introd. 5 26. The first triumph ex Africa Pompeius
only formally received from the senate, really from Sulla,
whose impotent tool the senate was: Plut. Pomp. 13.

c. xxn. illorum auctoritatem. From the time of the
Sullan reaction to the restoration of the tribunician power in
B.c. 70 (Introd. ἓ 29), the rule had been wholly in the hands
of the senate, and the sanction of the popular assembly had
been rarely sought for its ordinances. From the senate pro-
ceeded a seiies of extraordinary messuros, which overstepped
the existing lawe, such as the mission of Pompeius to Spain,
the bestowal of the imperium on M. Antonius (Introd. § 30
with note 87), etc. Cicero now skilfully avails himself of this
fact to claim for the people also they right of similar con-

cessions.

suo 1ure, ‘with the right which belongs to it‚’ which it
can claim because of its fortunate decision in the case of the
war with the pirates. [So meo iure ‘ with full right ' etc.]

ξ 64. parum consuluistis. Cicero says this because he
always sees expediency only in fortunate external results.
