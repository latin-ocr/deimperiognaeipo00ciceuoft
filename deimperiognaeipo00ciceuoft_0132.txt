ANALYSIS.

5 1. This is the first occasion, Romans, on which Ι have
addressed you from the rostra. 5 2. Hitherto Ι have served
you in the law-comte, and my triumphant election as praetor
showed that you approved this course. 5 3. The merits of
Pompeius make my present task an easy one.

55 4, 5. Α dangerous war is being waged in Asia, and all
call for Pompeius to conduct it. 5 6. 1 must first point out to
you the character of the war, and the vastness of the interests
at stake. 5 7 . The stain of your former war with Mithridates
has not yet been wiped away. 5 8. Sulla and Murena were
prevented from carrying the war to a conclusion. 5 9. Mith-
ridates made great preparatione for a new war, to be carried on
in alliance with Sertorius in Spain. 5 10. Pompeius crushed
the latter: Lucullus contended with the former at first with

war is not one to be despised, 5 21, although Lucullus has
gained many brilliant victories, 5 22. Mithridates himself
escaped from his hands, 5 23, and has secur-ed the help of
Tigranes, and many powerful tribes. 5 24. Our soldiers were
eager to return, and the misfortunes of Mithridates excited
much sympathy for him. 5 25. Suffer me to pass over the
story of our defeat. 5 26. Lucullus has been re-called3 you
see the importance of the war.

5 27. You have no general to compare with Pompeius.
5 28. His skill and experience in war are unrivalled. 5 29.
His military merite cannot be exaggerated. 5 30. Italy,
Sicily, Africa, Gaul, Spain and Italy again bear witness to
