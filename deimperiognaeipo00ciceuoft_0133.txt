bours were not safe. 5 34. Pompeius showed the greatest
energy in protecting Sicily, Africa, and Sardinia.. 5 35. He
completed the whole of his task within six months.

5 36. Remember, too, his integrity, self-control, good saith,
courtesy‚ and kindliness. 5 37. Other generals-you know
who—have shown themselves corrupt. 5 38. The armies of
such men are more dreaded by allies than by enemies. 5 39.
Pompeius allows no excesses in his army. 5 40. He shows
sslf-control in every other respect. 5 41. Hence men now
believe once more in the old Roman character. 5 42. His
eourtesy, his wisdom and eloquence‚ his fidelity to his word,
and his kindliness, unite to make him most fit to finish this
war.

5 43. The weight of his name is also of the greatest im-
portance. 5 44. All the world knows the honour in which he
is held at Rome. 5 45. The mere knowledge that he was near
checked Mithridates and Tigranes after their victory. 5 46.
The conduct of our enemies, too, shows how highly he is
esteemed by them. 5 47. His good fortune again is not less
remarkable. 5 48. It has been greater than anyone 1188 ever
ventured to desire for himself. 5 49. For these reasons, you
cannot hesitate as to your duty. 550. Besides, he is in the
neighbourhood.

5 51. But Catulus and Hortensius, men of the greatest
influence, oppose this proposal. 5 52. Hortensius argues that
all power is not to be put into the hands of one man. But
such language is out of date. 5 53. If he had been listened to
when he said the same thing against the Gabinian law, the
glory and empire of Rome would have been lost. 5 54. For
some years before this law, Rome was weaker in sels-defence
than the weakest of states. 5 55. We could not protect even
the reads of Italy. 5 56. The Roman people did not follow
your advice then, Hortensius, and Pompeius has now restored
to us our empire by land and sea. 5 57. Hence it is a shame
that Gabinius has not been allowed to be one of his lieutenants.
5 58. Others have been in the year after their tribuneship;
and 1 promise to bring the matter before the Senate. 5 59.
Catulus argued that you had no one to take the place of Pom-
peius if anything happened to him3 but you replied that you
had Catulus himself. 5 60. He urges that it is against 811
precedent, but he has himself approved of many new prece-
dente in the case of Pompeius. 55 61, 62. What indeed has
been so unprecedented as the whole history of Pompeius? 5 63.
Besides, you have already given your judgment against these
men in choosing Pompeius to command against the pirates.
5 64. Results have proved that you are right in this. Further‚
other virtues than those of a soldier are required in the East.
5 65. The avarice of our commandere there has made 118
detested. 5 66. Therefore no one must be sent to Asia but
