CRITIOAL APPENDIX (1894).

The MSS. on which Halm mainly relied to determine the
text of this oration were

1. Ρ, a leaf of a palimpsest at Tutin, containing §40
tollendae-5 43 de quo homine.

B 12. Ε, Εγῄιτεεηεὶε, a MS. of the XIIth century, now at
er m.

3. T, Temrnseensz‘s, a MS. of the XIth century, now at
Munich. This now begins at ξ 46: its readings for the earlier
portion are derived from a copy at Hildesheim. P is of
course a mere fragment: Halm attached much importance to
Τ. But more recent researches have shown that two other
MSS. belong to the same family as P, and are on the whole
our best authorities. These are

4. 0, coloniensis, 01100 111 the Cathedral Library at Gologne,
but now one of the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum,
whence it is called H by Mr A. Ο. Clark, who has described it
very fully in Anecdota oxoniensia, Classical Series, Part vn.

5. W, Werdemis‚ now lost, but collated by Gulielmius.

Another important MS. is

6. V, Vaticanus, one of the Palatine MSS. (1525) in the
Vatican Library at Rome, which belongs to the same class as
Ε, but is less accurate.

The best opinion seems to be that PGW represent the most
trustworthy family, that E V go together, and are less good3
and that Τ is only the best representative of the inferior class,
to which the numerous later MSS. belong. These are mostly
of Italian origin, and contain many conjectural emendations
by Italian scholars, while those of German origin have been
transcribed with less intelligence but more fidelity.

It follows therefore that when G (H) agrees with E V, the
evidence of Τ is not of much weight. If this view is conset
Halm’s text will need to be altered in the following places :—

ξ 4. arbitrantur: arbitratur HT.

ἓ 7. denotavit: curavit HEVT.
commoratur: commoretur H.
